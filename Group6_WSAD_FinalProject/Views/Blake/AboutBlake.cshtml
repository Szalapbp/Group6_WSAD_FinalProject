                <p>Hello, my name is Blake Szalapski and I am a 5th year IT Game Development and Simulation major. I'm originally from Northwest Ohio near Toledo. Game engines I have worked with throughout my degree include Unity, Unreal Engine 5, and Phaser.
                 I am currently working on a Unity game project for my Senior Capstone Project along with four other teammates. I have previously held four Co-ops at Sportsmans Market INC, better known as Sportys Pilot
                Shop, as the assistant to the system administrator. It was a networking heavy position where I would regularly configure physical network components like:
                </p>
                    <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Firewalls</li>
                    <li>Switches</li>
                    <li>Wiring</li>
                    <li>Servers</li>
                    <li>User PCs</li>
                    <li>Security Cameras</li>
                </ul>
                    <br />
                <p>
                    Other than networking, I was also in charge of doing most of the help-desk troubleshooting for users, internet connectivity, and printers.
                </p>
